# Data Collection Documentation

## Introduction

Data Collection is a cloud-based application that aims to revolutions institution-tailored data gathering by creating customizable forms.

The application defines a single parent organization which can then add other institutions on demand to give them a customized workspace. The institutions then can manage users, projects, forms, and collected data.

An institution admin can create a robust form with a custom combination of standard inputs and custom validations and select the privacy level of the form.

Once a form is submitted, the admin can view all submitted responses in their dashboard and apply custom queries to generate extensive reports that satisfy their business objective.


## Docs entry file

The entry file for the documentation is `docs.md` which is written in markdown format.
